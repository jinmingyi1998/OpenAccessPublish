##DEVELOPER PROGRESS (A LIST OF ITEMS):
1.  We read through the documents sent to us by our teacher and learned that BBS of our project is different from other BBS. And we know this project concerns free, community-based, and open academic publishing. The most obvious point is that our BBS does not need to register, but only needs to collect the user's email address.
2.  According to this project will use Flask framework, we decided to learn about Flask first. In fact, we have adopted the form of learning while doing projects.We make a plan that we learn Flask until 4th Nov. After that we will begin to complete this project.
3.  We plan to finish the design of the front end of the web page in about 3 days, and it then takes 3 or 5 days to complete the database design and code related to the previous interconnection. Next, we will go to implement the author publish his article and other users can make comments on the article. Actually, after discussing with teacher, we reach a consensus that the best way is to collect the IP address of this academic publishing project users'. After that, we plan to implement the popularity metric list according to the votes by users. Then we can complete the function of downloading and searching. During this time of finishing this project, administrator can access to database and adjust all the codes of any function. At the end of the project, we just need to debug the codes and maintenance with our project.
4.  So far,We have a general understanding of the Flask framework and implement some function of our project. We have completed the design of the web page, simply and simply. We don't think academic websites need to be fancy, serious and clean. We using flask-mail to implement making e-mail address as an ID of user, flask-sqlalchemy on database and flask-wtf with form.
